## Step 1: Create a pull request

_Welcome to "Managing Merge Conflicts"! :wave:_

**What is a _merge conflict_?**: A **merge conflict** occurs when changes are made to the same part of the same file on two different branches. You usually find out about conflicts in a pull request so let's start by creating one.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. We made a small change to a file in the repository in the `my-resume` branch.
1. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) setting `my-resume` as the head branch and `main` as the base branch. You can enter `Resolving merge conflicts` for the pull request title and body.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
