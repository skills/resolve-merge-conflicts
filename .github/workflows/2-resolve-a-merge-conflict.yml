name: Step 2, Resolve a merge conflict

# This step triggers after the user resolves the merge conflict
# This step sets STEP to 3
# This step closes <details id=2> and opens <details id=3>

# This will run every time we push to `my-resume` (this will be a merge commit 
# since the user is resolving a merge conflict)
