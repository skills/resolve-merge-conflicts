## Welcome

Merge conflicts happen when two people make changes to the same file on GitHub—a common occurrence when you’re working with others. While resolving differences might involve some discussion, merge conflicts don’t have to be scary. This course guides you through the steps to finding the best merge conflict solution, so your team can keep building.

- **Who is this for**: New developers, new GitHub users, users new to Git, students, managers, teams.
- **What you'll learn**: What merge conflicts are, how you resolve merge conflicts, how to reduce merge conflicts.
- **What you'll build**: We'll work with a short Markdown resume file in this course.
- **Prerequisites**: We recommend taking [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) prior to this course.
- **How long**: This course takes less than 30 minutes to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Create a pull request
2. Resolve a merge conflict
3. Create a merge conflict
4. Merge your pull request

### How to start this course

<summary>Having trouble? 🤷</summary><br/>

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds:

1. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the issue created in your repository.
3. If the page doesn't refresh automatically, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.
   - Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.
   - If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! 🐛
