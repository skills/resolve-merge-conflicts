Merge conflicts happen when two people make changes to the same file on GitHub—a common occurrence when you’re working with others. While resolving differences might involve some discussion, merge conflicts don’t have to be scary. This course guides you through the steps to finding the best merge conflict solution, so your team can keep building.

- **Who is this for**: New developers, new GitHub users, users new to Git, students, managers, teams.
- **What you'll learn**: What merge conflicts are, how you resolve merge conflicts, how to reduce merge conflicts.
- **What you'll build**: We'll work with a short Markdown resume file in this course.
- **Prerequisites**: We recommend taking [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) prior to this course.
- **How long**: This course is three steps long and takes less than 30 minutes to complete.

## How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'resolve-merge-conflicts',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-resolve-merge-conflicts',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

_Welcome to "Managing Merge Conflicts"! :wave:_

**What is a _merge conflict_?**: A **merge conflict** occurs when changes are made to the same part of the same file on two different branches. You usually find out about conflicts in a pull request so let's start by creating one.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. We made a small change to a file in the repository in the `my-resume` branch.
1. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) setting `my-resume` as the head branch and `main` as the base branch.  You can enter `Resolving merge conflicts` for the pull request title and body.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

_Good start! Now let's look deeper at a merge conflict! :mag:_

This can be intimidating, but have no fear, Git is smart when it comes to merging! Git only needs a human to decide how to [resolve the conflict](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line). Sometimes, the best way to resolve a merge conflict is to add content that's from both branches, or even something that isn't on either! This is why Git needs a human to look at the code and make the proper fixes.

### :keyboard: Activity: Resolve a merge conflict

1. Open the pull request that you just created, we created a conflict for you. Have no fear!
1. At the bottom of the page, under "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved", click the **Resolve conflicts** button.
1. Look for the highlighted sections that begins with  `<<<<<<<  my-resume` and ends with `>>>>>>> main`. These markers are added by Git to show you the content that is in conflict.
1. Remove the changes made on the main branch by deleting all of the content below the `=======` and above `>>>>>>> main`.
1. Next, remove the merge conflict markers by deleting the following lines:
   ```
   <<<<<<< my-resume
   =======
   >>>>>>> main
   ```
1. With the merge conflict markers removed, click **Mark as resolved**.
1. Finally, click **Commit merge**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<summary><h2>Step 3: Create your own conflict</h2></summary>

_Good job! You've solved a merge conflict! :tada:_

Resolving a conflict doesn't automatically merge the pull request in GitHub. Instead, it stores the resolution of the conflict in a merge commit and allows you and your team to keep working. To resolve a conflict, GitHub performs what is known as a *reverse merge*. This means that the changes from the `main` branch were  merged into your `my-resume` branch. With a reverse merge, only the `my-resume` branch is updated. This allows you to test the resolved changes on your branch before you merge it into `main`.

Now, let's get a little evil. (It's for educational purposes!)

### :keyboard: Activity: Create your own conflict

We went ahead and added a new file called `references.md` and pushed that change to `main`, without updating your `my-resume` branch.

1. Browse to the `my-resume` branch.
1. Click the `Add file` dropdown menu and then on `Create new file`.
1. Create a file named `references.md`.
1. Enter some text that conflicts with what we added for `references.md` in the `main` branch.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and enter a commit message for your change.
1. Click the **Commit new file** button, making sure the "Commit directly to the `my-resume` branch" option is selected.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

_Almost there! :heart:_

You can now [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) your pull request!

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your pull request

1. First, resolve any remaining conflicts in your pull request.
   > Look back at step one if you need help.
1. Click **Merge pull request**.
1. Delete the branch `my-resume` (optional).
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.
